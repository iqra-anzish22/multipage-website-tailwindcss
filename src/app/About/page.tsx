Welcome to my Website! I am a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for building user-friendly, responsive web applications. Skilled in technologies such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React, I strive to deliver high-quality, visually engaging websites that provide a seamless experience for users.

Over the past few months, I’ve been on a journey to enhance my development skills, completing numerous projects from e-commerce sites to food recipe platforms. Each project has allowed me to explore new features, refine my coding techniques, and deepen my knowledge in web development.

**My Mission**

This website is a showcase of my skills, projects, and passion for development. My goal is to connect with like-minded individuals, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in quality web development. As I continue learning and expanding my expertise, I aim to bring innovative ideas to life and contribute meaningfully to the tech world.

**Get in Touch**

If you’re interested in collaborating, hiring, or simply want to discuss tech, feel free to reach out! You can contact me through my email or connect on LinkedIn.

Special thanks to my mentors, Sir Asharib Ali and Miss Mehak Alamgir, whose guidance has been invaluable in my journey.
